### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Minko Minkov.

I'm someone who's a bit of a movie fanatic, that likes to go rock climbing, and bouldering from time to time.

I like doing a lot of statistics and combinatorics type problems. And I also enjoy learning about full-stack development.

If you fancy looking at a website, or just want to browse at a little project of mine, I'd be quite honoured for you to have a look. I hope you have a good day!
