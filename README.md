### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Minko Minkov.

I'm someone who's a bit of a movie fanatic, that likes to go rock climbing, and bouldering from time to time.

If you don't see me at the cinema watching an indie-movie, you'll probably find me messing with the Vue.js composition API.

If you fancy looking at a slightly fancy website, or just want to browse at a little project of mine, I'd be quite honoured for you to have a look. I hope you have a good day!
